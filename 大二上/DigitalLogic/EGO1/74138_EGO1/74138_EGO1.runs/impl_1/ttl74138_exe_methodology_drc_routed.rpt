2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f0_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f2_inferred__1/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f2_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f3_inferred__0/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f3_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f4_inferred__0/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f4_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f5_inferred__0/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f5_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f6_inferred__0/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f6_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#7 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/f7_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/f7_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f0_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f0_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f1_reg/L7 (in U/f1_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f1_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f2_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f2_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f3_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f3_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f4_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f4_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f5_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f5_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f6_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f6_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/f7_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/f7_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
