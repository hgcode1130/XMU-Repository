2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y0_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y0_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y2_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y2_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y3_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y3_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y4_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y4_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#5 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y5_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y5_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y6_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y6_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#7 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U/y7_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U/y7_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y0_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y0_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y1_reg/L7 (in U/y1_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y1_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y2_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y2_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y3_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y3_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y4_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y4_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y5_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y5_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y6_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y6_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch U/y7_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin U/y7_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
